# Project Structure — Watt Security

This document describes every folder in the project and the role of every future file within it. It extends the high-level structure already introduced in `README.md` with full implementation-level detail.

## 2. Root-Level Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The homepage — implements all 14 sections defined in `specifications/HOME_PAGE_SPECIFICATION.md`, in order. |

## 3. `pages/` — Role of Each File

See `PAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full content detail per page. In summary:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `about.html` | Expanded company story, values, and team — deeper version of the homepage's Presentation and Team sections. |
| `services.html` | Full detail on all nine services, expanding on the homepage Service Cards. |
| `gallery.html` | Complete photo and video gallery (the homepage gallery sections show only a curated subset). |
| `contact.html` | Standalone, full-page contact experience (form + map + all contact channels), for visitors who land directly on a "contact" search result or link. |
| `legal-notice.html` | Legal/company registration information ("Mentions légales"). |
| `privacy-policy.html` | Data collection and privacy practices, particularly relevant given the Contact form collects personal data. |

## 4. `assets/css/` — Role of Each File

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `tokens.css` | All CSS custom properties (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--font-*`, etc.) generated directly from `design/COLOR_PALETTE.md`, `design/TYPOGRAPHY.md`, and `design/SPACING.md`. The single source of truth every other CSS file reads from. |
| `base.css` | Reset/normalize rules, base typography applied to raw elements (`body`, `h1`–`h6`, `p`, `a`, `ul`/`ol`), base focus-visible styling. |
| `layout.css` | Site-wide structural rules: header/nav bar, footer, page containers/max-width, the 12-column grid, section vertical rhythm (per `design/SPACING.md`). |
| `components.css` | Every reusable component style, matching `COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` one-to-one: buttons, cards (service/team/testimonial), badges, alerts, forms, accordion, gallery items, counters, WhatsApp button. May be split into multiple files later if it grows too large — see `CSS_ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
| `utilities.css` | A small, deliberately limited set of helper classes (e.g., `.visually-hidden`, `.text-center`) — not a full utility-class framework (per the "no framework" decision in `FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`). |
| `pages/*.css` | Page-specific rules only for the rare cases where a page needs a layout tweak not covered by shared layout/components — kept minimal by design. |

## 5. `assets/js/` — Role of Each File

See `JAVASCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full detail. In summary, `main.js` is the only file referenced directly by HTML (`<script type="module" src="assets/js/main.js">`); it imports whichever `modules/*.js` files are relevant to the current page.

## 6. `assets/images/`, `assets/videos/`, `assets/icons/`, `assets/fonts/`, `assets/documents/`

Subfolder categories mirror `specifications/MEDIA_SPECIFICATION.md` exactly, so any contributor sourcing or adding media knows precisely where a new asset belongs without guessing. `assets/icons/` holds only the specific SVGs actually used (exported/copied individually from Phosphor Icons per `design/ICONOGRAPHY.md`), not the entire icon library, to keep the repository lean.

## 7. `data/`

Reserved for structured content that may be externalized from raw HTML in a future milestone — for example, a `services.json` or `faq.json` if the team decides to generate repetitive markup (service cards, FAQ items) from a single data source rather than duplicating near-identical HTML blocks by hand. **This is a future-facing placeholder, not a decision to build a data-driven templating system now** — flagged as an open question at the end of this milestone, since it would require either a build step or a small amount of JavaScript-driven rendering, both of which interact with the "no build tool" default in `FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 8. Naming Discipline

Every file and folder above follows the conventions defined in `FILE_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md` — lowercase, kebab-case, descriptive. No file should ever be added to this structure with a name that doesn't fit an existing category above without first updating this document.
